## Introduction

### Project Context

Logistics is essential for businesses to manage shipments and deliver products on time, providing the necessary and timely transportation of goods and services across the entire supply chain. All industries depend on logistics to maintain competitive advantages, fulfill customer satisfaction, and follow timely delivery of products. On the other hand, although logistics is a key player, it suffers from systemic inefficiencies whereby operational performance and scalability are being held back. Such challenges are further exacerbated by the continuous use of outdated procedures, various tools, and manual workflows, which altogether hinder progress in an ever-developing digital economy.

Logistics operations, meanwhile, face other key challenges arising from delays in shipment tracking, inconsistency in pricing, and slow manual operations that amount to less efficient practices. Such challenges directly affect customer satisfaction, higher operational costs, and loss of new business opportunities. For example, companies are severely slow-down in real-time monitoring due to outdated systems. An example of this would be the manual of spreadsheets, standalone GPS devices, or paper-based records. Data entry by hand, a regular aspect of the logistics process, often leads to errors such as delayed deliveries, billing disputes, and customer complaints. As per MIT research in 2020, fragmented logistics systems contribute to unnecessary operational costs, due to a large share of work hours put into error correction and data reconciliation.

A root problem is the lack of integration among logistics processes. A variety of systems for order management, shipment tracking, and financial reporting are operated in separate silos-an inter-island system where workers wind up toggling between systems and duplicating one another's effort. Such disintegration slows down workflow efficiency and creates communication gaps between stakeholders. Customers receiving obsolete shipment statuses and disruption managers lacking real-time visibility to proactively handle anything mean that this system is immobilized through manual processing. Manual quote generation is yet another pain area, which involves some sophisticated calculations based on the cargo weight, dimensions, and its destination, a type of job that is simply begging for miscalculations that would eat through profit margins and customer trust.

For this specific reason, this research proposes a web-based logistics management system intended to unify critical workflows into a single system. The system aims to automate repetitive tasks like generating quotes and creating invoices while providing real-time visibility of shipment status through GPS integration and driver update. By combining tracking, order management, and billing, the solution addresses manual errors, operational cost reduction, and transparency across the logistics lifecycle.

The proposed system, therefore, directly confronts inefficiencies across three categories. First, a real-time shipment tracker enables the company to remotely witness delivery progress, thus reducing the potential for customers to raise issues.

### Web-Based Logistics Tools for Small Firms: A Cost-Effective Approach to Shipment Tracking and Billing Automation (al-Maamari and Lee 2024)

Recent research by al-Maamari and Lee (2024) examined a web-based logistics system similar to our project. Their study involved 20 logistics companies in Oman testing the system for six months. The platform featured real-time shipment tracking and automated invoice generation. Results demonstrated significant improvements over traditional manual methods.

The findings revealed three key benefits from using the system. Delivery delays decreased by 22% due to instant status updates from drivers. Automated invoices reduced billing errors by 30% compared to manual entry. Customer complaints dropped 40% as clients could track orders online instead of calling for updates. These changes led to both cost savings and improved service quality.

However, the study identified several implementation challenges worth noting. About half of participating companies reported difficulties training employees in the new system. Long-time staff particularly resisted changing their established work routines. Rural operations faced additional hurdles with unreliable internet connectivity. Researchers recommended developing offline capabilities and more intuitive training materials.

The tested system incorporated several core functionalities relevant to our work. GPS technology enabled live monitoring of shipments in transit. Dynamic pricing automatically calculated costs using package dimensions and weight. Completed deliveries triggered immediate invoice generation and distribution. Custom user accounts provided appropriate access levels for different roles.

While effective, the system's $800 monthly price proved prohibitive for many small firms. Our project addresses this by streamlining features to reduce costs. We also incorporated flexible language support missing in the original study. These adaptations make the solution more accessible to budget-conscious operations.

This research confirms web-based tools can significantly benefit small logistics providers. However, affordability and ease of adoption remain critical factors for success. Our project builds on these findings while solving the identified pain points. The goal is delivering similar benefits through a more practical and cost-effective solution.

### Development of a Web-based Research Consortium Database Management System: Advancing Data-driven and Knowledge-based Project Management (Salvador et al., 2024)

The study of Salvador et al. (2024) focused on developing a centralized web-based system for managing data across 29 member institutions under the Central Luzon Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources Research and Development Consortium (CLAARRDEC). One of the key problems addressed was the manual method of compiling research reports and tracking project progress, which often resulted in inconsistencies and delays in data retrieval.

The system was designed to allow real-time monitoring of projects and easier access to information, aiming to improve transparency and collaboration across institutions. This is relevant to logistics systems where accurate and up-to-date records, such as delivery logs, inventory updates, and order tracking are critical. By implementing modules for uploading, storing, and searching data, as well as generating reports, the project helped streamline operations and reduced the burden of manual work. These features are similar to what a logistics system needs, especially in businesses where real-time coordination and database integrity are essential for efficient order fulfillment and stock management.

### Synthesis

Digital tools such as real-time tracking, data analytics, and automation are critical for enhancing operational performance, reducing costs, and improving customer satisfaction. Oman's potential as a logistics hub depends on overcoming infrastructure and regulatory challenges while fostering collaboration among stakeholders. Studies (e.g., al-Maamari and Lee, 2024) demonstrate that web-based platforms with GPS tracking, automated billing, and dynamic pricing significantly reduce delays, errors, and customer complaints. However, affordability and ease of adoption are critical for small firms.

The CLAARRDEC system (Salvador et al., 2024) underscores the value of real-time data sharing and automated reporting for transparency and efficiency. Similar features (e.g., delivery logs, inventory updates) are essential for logistics systems.

LogiSync: is a tool that helps businesses run their delivery and shipping operations more smoothly. It does this by using automation and live updates to make things faster, more accurate, and better for customers. With LogiSync, companies can adjust quickly to changes and manage their logistics in a much easier and smarter way.

The difference between existing logistics platforms and our systems is that it integrates real-time tracking, automated quotes/invoicing, and centralized logistics modules into a cost effective web platform, unlike existing systems that are either too expensive (al-Maamari & Lee), non-logistics-specific (CLAARRDEC/Davao project), or overly niche (UAV-blockchain).

LogiSync bridges gaps in existing solutions by offering an integrated, affordable, and logistics-tailored system with automation at its core. LogiSync is a comprehensive, web-based logistics management system designed to automate and integrate key logistics workflows (shipment tracking, order and warehouse management, transport coordination, quotes, and data analytics).

## Methodology

### Technical Background

#### Overview of Related Technologies

Logistics companies today share a number of challenges, this includes management of repetitive tasks such us management of quotations, transportation, and order processing. And some companies continue to rely on conventional methods like paper and spreadsheets like Excel. Tracking multiple factors can be challenging for Logistics Officers. This project aims to develop a system to help Logistics companies achieve greater operational efficiency, this will also enhance decision making capabilities and help organize certain functions and boost productivity.

This web application will use ReactJS and Tailwind CSS for the front end. ReactJS helps us build reusable components to create a smooth and responsive user interface. Tailwind CSS allows for quick and flexible styling directly within the markup, making the design process faster and the app look good on different devices.

On the backend, the developers will use Laravel and MySQL. Laravel organizes the server-side code neatly and simplifies database interactions. MySQL is a database that securely stores user data and tasks, ensuring data reliability even under heavy use.

The development of LogiSync follows a structured approach to ensure a systematic and efficient process in building a comprehensive logistics management system. This methodology is divided into distinct phases, each building upon the previous one to ensure clarity, thoroughness, and alignment with project goals. The project ultimately adheres to the Waterfall Model, which provides a clear framework for managing the development process.

The project will commence with a feasibility study to assess technical, operational, and financial viability. Stakeholder interviews and market research will be conducted to identify pain points, validate the need for LogiSync, and prioritize core features using the MoSCoW method (Musthave, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have). Once the most important are identified, writing down exactly what the system needs to do like how admins create shipments or how tracking updates work will be done.

Then during the design phase, the developers plan how everything looks and works, including drawing website layouts, designing the database, and making mockups with tools like Figma.

After that, building the system in small parts will begin on the coding phase, working in two-week cycles to add features like logins, GPS tracking, and billing. Each part will be tested as it is being finished.

Once all parts are built, testing on how they work together will start, like checking if creating a quote automatically makes an invoice and asking users to try it out. Speed test and security checks will also be tested.

When testing is done, the developers launch the system in a test environment first to fix last-minute issues, then roll it out slowly to real users while training them. Tools like AWS CloudWatch will monitor it to keep it running smoothly.

After launch, the developers will keep updating the system with fixes and new features based on feedback, and a support team will help users with problems.

This follows the Waterfall steps feasibility, requirements, design, coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance one after another. Each phase depends on finishing the one before it but adjustment of small things along the way depending on if users need changes will be done. This keeps things organized and makes sure the system solves real problems without getting too complicated.

#### Calendar of Activities

The Gantt chart presents the summary of activities. Listed are the activities and opposite them are their duration or periods of execution. Below are the legends of activity indication where BLUE indicates as starting or not finished and YELLOW as on progress or finished.

First, the developers brainstormed ideas for a title and topic. In the second and third week of February, these ideas are then presented during the title defense, and the best title was approved. The fourth week of February was spent on data gathering where the developers started researching and looking for companies for interview while the first week of March was spent on a face-to-face interview with a company.

The second week of March is where the writing began, with the data gathered from research and interview, the Project Context, Purpose and Description, Objectives, and Scope and Limitations was started. With Consultations from our adviser, the Project Context, Purpose and Description, Objectives, and Scope and Limitations were revised and updated.

In the second week of April, Research for Review of Related Literature was begun and all the members assigned compiled all of it in the fourth week of April including the Technical Background. The Objectives, Scope and Limitations, Review of Related Literature were then redefined once more after further consultations with the adviser, the Requirements Gathering and Analysis was started the same week.

The Requirements Gathering and Analysis was then revised and polished in the second week of May and in the same week, the Diagrams, Resources, Requirement Documentation and Appendix were documented.

## Requirements Analysis

The developers formulated a set of questions for the planned interview with the Logistics Officer and Accountant Executive. The information stated by the respondents along with the research data collected were then used as a basis for writing the documentation, most especially the project context, purpose and description, objectives, and scope and limitations.

Admins and head office managers are the primary users of LogiSync. They use the system to manage all logistics tasks. For example, the Shipments Management Module lets admins create shipments by inputting details like sender/receiver info, origin, and destination. Each shipment generates a unique tracking number, which admins share with their clients. The Transportation Management Module helps head office managers assign drivers to deliveries, plan routes, and monitor vehicle schedules.

Drivers, who are part of the admin's team, receive tasks through the system and update delivery statuses via mobile devices. Admins also use the Orders Management Module to oversee order fulfillment. The warehouse manager update order statuses like "packed" or "shipped" under admin supervision.

Clients (the admin's customers) do not have full accounts. Instead, they access a public tracking page on the admin's website or a shared link. By entering their tracking number clients will see real-time updates like "in transit" or "delivered."

The Quotes Management Module lets admins calculate shipping costs automatically based on package weight and dimensions. After delivery, the Invoice Module generates bills automatically, reducing manual errors. Admins can also use the Reporting and Analytics Module to review performance metrics like delivery times or driver efficiency.

LogiSync offers three subscription plans designed to meet the needs of businesses at different stages. The Basic Plan provides a 30-day free trial for initial exploration with limited features. The Standard Plan includes all core features (shipment tracking, order management, quotes, invoices, and email support) while supporting up to 100 shipments per month, with a limit of up to 10 warehouses. The Premium Plan includes the same features as the Standard Plan but removes the warehouse limitation, allowing users to add an unlimited number of warehouses and additional staff members like the booking manager, warehouse manager, and driver, all available in flexible 1, 3, or 5-year terms.

Staff and drivers have limited access for example, drivers can only update delivery statuses and view the shipment details, while admins manage permissions. Clients only see their own shipment details via tracking numbers. Usability is prioritized: the admin dashboard is simple, with clear menus for tasks like creating shipments or viewing reports. Training guides help admins onboard staff quickly.

Overall, LogiSync gives admins full control over their logistics work, while clients get a hassle-free way to track packages. The system cuts out paperwork, reduces errors, and saves time.

### Warehouse Manager Dashboard

The Warehouse Manager's dashboard provides a detailed view of all warehouse-related data and activities, offering insights into shipping statuses, and operational efficiency. The Warehouse Manager is also promptly notified by the Head Office manager regarding new orders that require management, ensuring a smooth and coordinated workflow for processing and fulfilling customer requests. This enables proactive management of warehouse operations and ensures timely order fulfillment.

### Transportation Page

The booking manager can select orders, then vehicles, and then plan the routes. They can also create a schedule for when to start loading the selected vehicle and notify the driver. The system will also incorporate tools for route optimization and real-time tracking.

---

## Design of Software, System, Product, and/or Processes

The developers designed use cases to visually outline how various actors, such as the administrator, head office manager, and booking manager interact with the system to achieve specific goals. These goals are represented as use cases. By illustrating these interactions, the diagram provides a clear, high-level understanding of the system's functionalities.

The developers also have created a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) this will visually depict how data moves between key processes and data stores within the system, involving actors like the administrator, head office manager, and booking manager to achieve their specific goals. These goals translate into data transformations and flows represented in the DFD. By illustrating these data movements and storage points, the diagram offers a clear, high-level understanding of how information is managed and utilized within the system to support its functionalities.

A hierarchical chart for this system will visually represent the organizational structure and relationships between functionalities, often reflecting the roles of the administrator, head office manager, and booking manager in accessing and managing these areas. These charts have a top-level node representing the overall system, branching down into key modules.

The database diagram shows key components like Shipments, Warehouse, and Orders, illustrating how they connect and relate to other elements such as Users and Transport.
